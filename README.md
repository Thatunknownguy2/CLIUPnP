# CLIUPnP
A simple CLI utility for forwarding ports using UPnP / NAT. Your router **must** support UPnP and have it enabled. TCP/UDP forwarding supported by using "Both"
as the protocol.

## Libraries Used
[Console Tables](https://github.com/khalidabuhakmeh/ConsoleTables)

[Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)

[Mono.Nat](https://github.com/alanmcgovern/Mono.Nat)

## Notice
This is my first real open source project that I have made public on GitHub. Please excuse the maybe not so good code and/or project structure. This is just my own take on
a UPnP utility program.
